	<h4>Alumni Homecoming - Parokya Ni Edgar</h4>
	<blockquote>This song was inspired by a true story of the band’s lead guitarist, Darius Semana. The idea came to mind when the band’s vocalist and lead guitarist talked about high school crushes. Darius suddenly remembered his crush in La Salle Lipa. He told how they became close and eventually become awkward because of their classmates teasing them. Darius told also how the girl’s partner did not attend their graduation and Darius became the partner of his crush. And that was the last time he saw her.</blockquote>
