	 I was born in the year 2001, and was given the name Sean Edward.<sup>1</sup> Watching cartoons, playing with my toys, and sleeping were 
	 usually the things I do to past time.<sup>2</sup> Being a kid had a lot of perks like freedom and I felt that everything that I wanted
	 was attainable, everything was simple and colorful.<sup>3</sup> I have been raised in a big family with lots of loving members I have a
	 brother and we play games everyday.<sup>4</sup>  At the age of 6 I entered Grade 1, around this time I was really nervous
	 about going to school, everything was new for me and I had a hard time interacting with children.<sup>5</sup> Not long enough I learned how
	 to interact with my classmates and started to play with them.<sup>6</sup> I really enjoyed going to school, we watch a lot of educational 
	 cartoons and sleep, it felt like I was at home.<sup>7</sup> School taught me a lot of things like counting, reading time, and basic 
	 communication.<sup>8</sup> I remember the time I was scoled by my teacher for eating during class and tried to give her a piece of my food, 
	 The class laughed as I burped really loud.<sup>9</sup> I feel excited whenever my family goes out to bond because I get to see a lot of toys 
	 outside as well as I get to eat a lot of delicious food.<sup>10</sup> When I hit the age of 7 my family and I went on a vacation to some place
	 unknown to me.<sup>11</sup> The people there talked in a language I do not understand, so I asked my parents why is there language different from
	 our language which we speak? My parents said that we are in a country which does not know and speak our language.<sup>12</sup> As I learned that 
	 me and my family are in a foreign land, I tried to interact with some people using a universal language which is english and to my surprise they understood me but as a young boy the only english word I knew was saying "Hi" or "Hello".<sup>13</sup> As a kid I was curious with a lot of things like why am I not to talk to strangers 
	 and why I should not play in malls.<sup>14</sup> I learned the reason to why I was told not to do those things because an incident happened wherein I bumped
	 to a an older guy for running in the mall he scolded me and told me that I should never play in a mall because I may hurt someone and a mall is not a playground.<sup>15</sup>
	 At the age of 10, I learned a lot of things one of them is that as I grow older I am not able to do things when I was a child like cry over small things and such.<sup>16</sup>
	 School was no different as I enter grade 4, we no longer have nap time and watch educational cartoons.<sup>17</sup> It was big adjustment for me since everything was new for 
	 me but as time pass by I began to adapt to everything.<sup>18</sup> As summer kicks in I have began hanging out with my friends and go to their house to play and sleep.
	 <sup>19</sup>To summarize everything I was an adventurous little boy who would always sneak around the house to do the things I enjoy doing.<sup>20</sup>

        <blockquote>
		My Teenage life started when I was in grade 7 At that time I was 13 years old and just graduated from elementary, I thought that I would need to adjust because it is yet another
		chapter in my life but to my surprise it the same as my elementary the only difference is that it’s more difficult and strict at the same time.<sup>1</sup> 
		My circle of friends started to shrink because some of them left and some of them went to another group, I became pretty much a learner during the first semester.<sup>2</sup> 
		But as time goes by I started to interact more and more with my classmates and became really close to them.<sup>3</sup> When we have our semestral break, my classmates and I 
		went to see a movie together and played games.<sup>4</sup> Everything went well and we finished our semester with flying colors.<sup>5</sup> 
		During the summer break, I enroll in a swimming school to past time, it was a challenge for me at first, but as time goes on I really got the hang of it.<sup>6</sup> My swimming
		lesson came to an end and there is still a lot of time left in my summer vacation, I spend it watching anime and reading some manga.<sup>7</sup> Summer finally ended and I 
		started my 8th grade, around this time I was taught by my father to drink alcoholic drinks the taste was new to me and I suddenly felt heavier.<sup>8</sup> That was the 
		first time I experience being drunk, it goes to show that I can’t really hold my drinks but as time passes by I started to gain tolerance over alcoholic drinks.<sup>9</sup> 
		My classmates were shocked when they knew that I drink alcohol due to an event wherein my classmate invited me over for a party, his parents ask me if I wanted to drink, and to their surprise, I drank 
		like some kind of old man.<sup>10</sup> It became a habit to us friends to drink after an exam or when an occasion occurs, this habit when on until we were in 10th grade.
		<sup>11</sup> Unlike the 7th grade, the 10th grade stressed me out because it was the time we were about to move up, which means that I need to focus on my studies and 
		lessen the habit of drinking.<sup>12</sup> The nerve wracking part was our thesis, at that time we were new to making thesis although they gave as an introduction on how a 
		thesis is done the problem is how can I apply those teachings to my our paper.<sup>13</sup> My classmates and I faced a lot of rejection mainly on the title of our paper and 
		on our conclusion, but thankfully our thesis got approved and all it needed was a minor revision.<sup>14</sup> We passed our thesis and I passed all of my test all that is 
		left is for the moving up rites, our moving up practice was fun, we got to joke around with our teacher and bonded a lot.<sup>15</sup> Then the day has finally arrive wherein
		all of us move forward to the next chapter of our lives, as we sing our schools hymn I can see my fellow classmates crying while holding each others hands then I realized that this will be the last time I 
		get to be with them, they have been with me for over 4 years and now we need to say farewell to each other and hope that our paths may cross again.<sup>16</sup> As I start 
		the new chapter of my life I felt nervous because this was the first time I get to study in a university, I chose the school UE because that is where my brother studies and I want to follow him.
		<sup>17</sup> At first I felt that I wouldn’t fit in with the rest but to my surprise everyone was friendly, if I were to ask on which circle of friendship I got attach to I 
		would answer my senior highschool friends because unlike my junior highschool friends they were simple yet they appreciate everything they have.<sup>18</sup> My 11th grade life
		went smoothly and I finally get to experience my first love, it all happened so fast that 
		I couldn’t answer her properly but there I was experiencing the joy of youth.<sup>19</sup> Me and my senior highschool friends started it together and now we are about to end it together but I can’t say the exact to my 
		first love because we broke up eventually due to circumstances, moving forward we are in our last year as seniors and are about to enter college, 2 years felt like only months for and now we are about to 
		graduate, I really enjoyed and felt thankful that I met such wonderful and marvelous people they througly made my teenage years special.<sup>20</sup>

        <blockquote>
		My College years started at the age of 18 yrs old.<sup>1</sup> I decided to stay at the University of the East and pursue the course Information Technology because I still like to follow my brother’s footprints.<sup>2</sup>
		I thought that I would start my 1st-year college with my old senior high classmates but to my surprise, I started my first year from scratch meaning I have to start all over again and make some friends.<sup>3</sup> So the first day of school came by and I feel nervous because I do not know anyone in my class, as I went to my designated classroom I see a lot 
		of people and they seem to be familiar with each other.<sup>4</sup> I thought that they already formed a group so I tried to sit next to them to know them more, but the teacher in front called my name and said that I was too early for my schedule so I went out of the room and some followed 
		then I ask them if we have the same section and they replied with a big yes.<sup>5</sup> So as we wait for our schedule I started talking with them, we had a few talks and introduce ourselves to each other.<sup>6</sup> So months pass by a made a lot of friends and groups have suddenly formed in our 
		classroom, We had a lot of laughs and helped each other out in every subject.<sup>7</sup> Prelims have passed by and we just finished our midterm exam, at this time I began to have a crush on my classmate, her name was Joan Christine Agosto.<sup>8</sup> Every time we move our chair to see our professor’s 
		PowerPoint presentation I get a chance to see her.<sup>9</sup> She was cheerful, beautiful, and most importantly she has the quality that I have been looking for<sup>10</sup> I wanted to talk to her but the problem is we never had a conversation before only small talks, I wanted to tell her how I feel but 
		I can’t so all I ever did was look at her from a long distance.<sup>11</sup> This feeling went on until the finals of our first sem I still haven’t talked to her yet and I don’t have the courage to do it, I felt sad and lonely because in the end I never got to tell her how I really felt and I 
		wouldn’t get another chance since she and I would be enrolling in a different section.<sup>12</sup> A month has passed and I enrolled for the second semester, I found out that my senior high school friends were my classmates, and it gave me a huge smile also some of my college friends were in the 
		section that I enrolled in.<sup>13</sup> But the icing to the cake was when I saw in the class group chat that my crush Joan was there and we were in the same section, I felt like this was my last opportunity to confess to her so I may have nothing to regret later.<sup>14</sup> Easier said than done I had a 
		hard time talking to her but if I was going to confess to her I need to get too close to her, so I finally had an opportunity to talk to her, and to my surprise, it went smoothly we were able to talk to each other and this continues for a month at some point we had a conversation on 
		why she isn’t in the same class as her friends and then she told me that she enrolled late, in a joking manner I told her that maybe your crush is in here in the room and then she said that he is in this class.<sup>15</sup> I felt really scared and nervous because my crush has someone she already l
		ikes, then I told her the names of our classmates to see who is the person she likes and then all that was left was me, then she said yes but it was a long time ago and she doesn’t feel any emotions for me this time, I was happy at the same time sad because my crush had a crush on me 
		but at the same time she doesn’t feel the same way anymore so I regretted not confessing to her in our first semester.<sup>16</sup> Days after that conversation we became clingy to each other to the point we were like a couple, we argued like a couple, flirt like couples, until the day finally came t
		hat I wanted to confess to her but the day before that I ask if where she was and then she answered that she is still in the university then I asked her if she wanted to go home together tomorrow which she replied with a yes.<sup>17</sup> So as talked about, the two of us went home together I ask her 
		if she wants to hang around for a bit and she gladly agreed to my request, the two of us bought milk tea and bought cakes as we get comfortable with each other I finally confessed to her, at first she thought I was kidding but I told her I was head over heels for her.<sup>18</sup> She then said she w
		anted time to think which I gladly accepted and told her that I fully respect her decision, weeks passed by since the confession and we were still clingy to each other, on the day of her birthday I gave her a present and escort her to her destination that day was filled with rainbows and 
		sunshine for me because I get to see her on her birthday, she told me that tomorrow we would hang out at my house so we can spend time for each other, the day came where we hang out in my house and she told me that she likes me too and I can be her boyfriend, I felt happiness and joy when 
		I heard her said that.<sup>19</sup> Now that one year has passed since that event, I am currently in my 2nd-year college, and Joan and I have been together for a year now and still counting, being in a relationship with her taught me a lot of things and I am really thankful that I met and confessed to 
		her because she is my motivation and my ray of sunshine.<sup>20</sup>
