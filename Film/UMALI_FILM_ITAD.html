	<h4>The Pursuit of Happyness</h4>
	<p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film directed by Gabriele Muccino and starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr. The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling 2006 memoir of the same name written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. It is based on Gardner's nearly one-year struggle being homeless. The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from a mural that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attends.The film was released on December 15, 2006 by Columbia Pictures, and received moderately positive reviews, with most critics particularly praising Smith’s performance. Smith was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for Best Actor.</p>
